                <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--border-color); margin-bottom:1rem;">
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Quick note before we begin, I am an aspiring offensive security professional with a growing portfolio of certifications and hands-on experience, particularly through platforms like <strong style="font-size: bold;">INE</strong> (formally known as eLearnSecurity), <strong style="font-size: bold;">TryHackMe</strong> and <strong style="font-size: bold;">HackTheBox</strong>. 
                    While I have made significant progress in my learning journey, I am still early in my career. 
                    This review reflects my personal experiences and observations so far, and I highly encourage readers to consider multiple perspectives when planning their own cybersecurity education paths.
                    <br><br>
                    This topic is important because many newcomers to cybersecurity face the same dilemma: Should I pursue a degree, stack certifications, or dive straight into practical experience? Will I land a job by the end of my studies? 
                    In this blog, I‚Äôll share how all three, classroom learning, professional certifications, and platforms like <strong style="font-size: bold;">TryHackMe</strong>, <strong style="font-size: bold;">HackTheBox</strong>, <strong style="font-size: bold;">INE</strong> and many more out there can be leveraged to build a well-rounded foundation. 
                    Whether you‚Äôre just starting out or looking to level up, I hope my insights offer some clarity and direction.
                </p>


                <h2 id="traditional">The Traditional Route: Cybersecurity University Degrees</h2>
                <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--border-color); margin-bottom:1rem;">
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Below are 2 overview tables highlighting pros, cons and job readiness offers by a Cybersecurity degree. There are several other points that I might not mention in the tables but again keep in mind that each University has its own curriculum. As such, I can‚Äôt pronounce myself much on the curriculum, however based on common statistics and patterns, the below tables can be taken into consideration.

                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Overall, a degree is a great starting point, but not enough on its own. A well structured curriculum combined with hands-on practice, certifications, and self-learning to be job-ready is the best approach. 
                    By the time of writing this blog (May 2025), I have an on-going subscription on HackTheBox where I have been actively learning for over a year and half after a good 6 months of grinding on TryHackMe.

                <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--border-color); margin-bottom:1rem;">
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Now comes the big question, should I focus on pursuing a Cybersecurity degree or invest in Certifications? Below is a quick summary table that I believe would give an overview of key differences between both hence help you decide.
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, as you‚Äôre reading this, you probably came across Job Role such as Red Teamer, Threat Hunter, Malware Analyst, SOC Analyst and so forth. Worry not, I also had no idea about either of these role when I first started. Hence, do review 20-coolest-cyber-security-careers from SANS Institute to learn more about Cybersecurity Careers. Please do keep it mind that YOU DO NOT NEED a GIAC or OffSec certification to get started in Cybersecurity (no offense to the giants).

                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Below are few considerations to take into account while choosing where to invest your time, money and resources.
                </p>
                <ul class="blog-list">
                    <li>If you seek broad knowledge, leadership roles, and comprehensive education, a degree is more suitable. Think of it like looking at the bigger picture and having an overall understanding of core key concepts.</li>
                    <li>If you want quick entry, specialization, or to supplement existing knowledge, certifications are ideal. Once again, I would prioritize hands-on certifications over MCQs even though both require in-depth knowledge of the target domains.</li>
                    <li>Despite the above, many professionals combine both to balance theory and practical skills, enhancing employability and adaptability. In my humble opinion, there is no such thing as practical skills without theory, therefore a mix of both is the best possible approach.</li>
                </ul>
                    

                <h2 id="hands-on">Practical Hands-On Experience: The Game Changer</h2>
                <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--border-color); margin-bottom:1rem;">
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    No amount of theory can ever replace the value of hands-on practice. Platforms like <a href="https://www.hackthebox.com/" target="_blank"><strong style="font-size: bold;"></strong>HackTheBox</strong></a>, <a href="https://tryhackme.com/" target="_blank"><strong style="font-size: bold;">TryHackMe</strong></a>, and <a href="https://ine.com/course/certified-blue-team-specialist" target="_blank"><strong style="font-size: bold;">INE</strong></a>‚Äôs labs have been instrumental in helping me build real-world offensive security skills. These environments simulate actual assessments and challenge you to think outside the box making it useful for real-world scenarios.

                    I won‚Äôt really dive much into each CTF platform individually, so feel free to explore the <a href="https://opensecuritylabs.com/blog/2024/10/top-10-best-ctf-platforms-2024/" target="_blank"><strong style="font-size: bold;">Top-10-Best-CTF-Platforms-2024</strong></a> from Open Security Labs and <a href="https://thecyberexpress.com/best-ctf-platforms-cybersecurity-skills/" target="_blank"><strong style="font-size: bold;">Best-CTF-platforms-for-cybersecurity-skills</strong></a> by the Cyber Express covering the top CTFs Platforms to master Cybersecurity.

                    I would always recommend my all time favorite <strong style="font-size: bold;">HackTheBox</strong> as the methodology utilized takes students out of their comfort zone making it invaluable. Moreover, if you‚Äôre serious about improving your skills, HTB Academy & Labs is one of the best place to start. Remember, self-learning and persistence leads to tangible skill growth.
                    <br><br>
                    Finding the right balance between academic coursework, certifications, and hands-on labs can be challenging, as it demands a high level of dedication and discipline. As such, prioritization is key to staying organized and making consistent progress. For instance, at the start of each semester, I would allocate more time to platforms like HackTheBox and pursue certifications such as eJPT, CBBH, and CPTS. As the semester progressed and academic demands increased, I would gradually adjust my focus to align with coursework deadlines and workload.

                        Cybersecurity starts with the wire, hence understanding TCP/IP scheme, most common used ports, mastering tools such as wireshark, tcpdump, nmap, netcat, and so on helps understand protocol weaknesses and how packets are being forward from one endpoint to another.

                        It‚Äôs essential to understand secure communication, encryption, and cracking. In fact, symmetric/asymmetric encryption, hashing, digital signatures, TLS, certificates, steganography and crypto attacks are common topics in the field. This is essential as it applies in Application Security (or AppSec for short), protocol analysis, CTFs and forensic challenges.

                <ol class="blog-list" style="text-align: justify;">
                    <li><strong>Learn and master the basics</strong></li>
                    Before diving into advanced tools or frameworks such as Nessus or Wazuh, make sure you truly understand how systems, networks, and protocols work. Solid foundations in Linux, networking, and OS internals will take you further than any automated tool ever will.
                    <br><br><li><strong>Commit to continuous learning</strong></li>
                    Cybersecurity is a fast-moving field. What works today might be obsolete tomorrow. Always keep learning whether it‚Äôs a new technique, framework, or certification. As surprising as it may sounds, I still do revisit previous modules from TryHackMe and HackTheBox to help me refresh some knowledge.
                    <br><br><li><strong>Balance theory and hands-on practice</strong></li>
                    Reading about privilege escalation is one thing, actually performing it in a lab is another. Labs like Hack The Box, TryHackMe, or even self-made VMs are excellent practice grounds. By the time of writing this (May 2025), I am undergoing Local Privilege Escalation Skill path from HackTheBox and believe it or not, what you learn from the Academy is far different from some techniques used in the labs. Watch, read, then do, matter of fact, adopt your own methodology if applicable.
                    <br><br><li><strong>Build your network</strong></li>
                    Connect with like-minded individuals online or in person. Join communities, attend webinars, CTF competitions, talk to people at conferences or even LinkedIn. You‚Äôll be surprised how many opportunities come from a simple conversation.
                    <br><br><li><strong>Document your journey</strong></li>
                    Take notes, write blogs, record your progress even if it‚Äôs just for yourself. Over time, this builds into a valuable knowledge base that can help compare the changes and see how much you have learned and become better. Additionally, sharing your journey might also inspire someone else, lead to mentorship or collaboration opportunities.

                <!-- Don‚Äôts -->
                <h3>‚ùå Don‚Äôts</h3>

                <ol class="blog-list" style="text-align: justify;">
                    <li><strong>Don‚Äôt rely solely on one learning path</strong></li>
                    Completing a learning path (like TryHackMe or HTB Academy) is great but don‚Äôt stop there. The main idea here is not just completing the paths but rather understanding key methodologies, techniques utilized and therefore going beyond.
                    <br><br><li><strong>Don‚Äôt neglect soft skills</strong></li>
                    Communication is just as important as technical skill. Whether you‚Äôre explaining findings to a client or reporting to a SOC team, the ability to clearly articulate your thoughts is vital. Growing up I thought Cybersecurity was all about running scripts and popping shells, I learned the hard way that writing, speaking, and active listening are far as equally important if not more.
                    <br><br><li><strong>Don‚Äôt ignore emerging trends.</strong></li>
                    The landscape is always changing cloud security, AI, threat intel, and zero trust are becoming mainstream. It‚Äôs advised to stay informed through blogs, newsletters, and conferences. The more you know about where things are headed, the more valuable you become. One more reason to give HTB a praise as they constantly update their modules with latest TTPs and tools.

                <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
                <hr style="border: 1px solid var(--border-color); margin-bottom:1rem;">
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Cybersecurity is a field that rewards curiosity, dedication, and adaptability. Whether you‚Äôre starting with a degree, certifications, or hands-on labs, the key is to blend all three for a truly well-rounded foundation. 
                    Remember, no matter the career you decide to pursue, you will come across tools such as <strong style="font-size: bold;">Metasploit, Wireshark, BurpSuite, Nessus, Nuclei, Splunk, Snort</strong> as well as common services (<strong style="font-size: bold;">FTP, SMB, RDP, DNS, Email services, and so forth</strong>) and common applications (<strong style="font-size: bold;">WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, Tomcat, Jenkins, GitLab, LDAP</strong> and much more).
                    <br><br>
                    In terms of balance, everybody has their own schedule and what is applicable to me might not be to someone else. Consequently, feel free to find the right balance between school, certification and hands-on labs at your own pace.
                    <br><br>
                    Long story short, I would highly recommend starting off with <strong style="font-size: bold;">TryHackMe</strong> as it is beginner friendly then progressively migrate to <strong style="font-size: bold;">HackTheBox</strong> as things get serious and more challenging. 
                    Check out <strong style="font-size: bold;">TryHackMe</strong> and <strong style="font-size: bold;">HackTheBox</strong> learning paths to choose where you see yourself. <strong style="font-size: bold;">Immediate action</strong> is key to achieving the best results.
