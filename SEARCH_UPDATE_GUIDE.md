## How to Add New Content

### Method 1: Update search-config.js (Recommended)
1. Open `/static/js/search-config.js`
2. Add your new blog post to the `blogPosts` array in the `discoverContent()` method
3. Include relevant keywords for better search matching

Example:
```javascript
{ 
  title: 'Your New Post', 
  url: 'blog/category/your-new-post.html', 
  fetch: 'blog/category/your-new-post.html', 
  category: 'category', 
  keywords: ['keyword1', 'keyword2', 'relevant', 'terms'] 
}
```
